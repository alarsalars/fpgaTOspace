# Demo fot Processor with VHDL testbench and Cocotb

 I found @Kumar Khandagle talking about designing a Processor in VHDL, I took him as reference and I am trying to douplicate his work with my own code implimitation but the main concept from him.

 It would be improved be using the memory as IN & OUT ports with BUS but for simplicity it used internal memory as array

 I will add a simple VHDL TB also I want to test it with COCOTB for covering COCOTB in good example
