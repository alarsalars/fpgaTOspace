# fpgaTOspace

This repository contains FPGA projects Iâ€™ve worked on in my free time to strengthen my skills and knowledge as an FPGA engineer. Each project is designed to explore key concepts, protocols, and methods essential for FPGA development.

The projects and code here serve as a personal reference, drawing on resources like articles, workshops, courses, and tutorials. All code is my own, with references to concepts where needed.

Contents
1. Basic Projects on ZCU1 Board
2. Standard Protocol Implementations
3. Verification Techniques
4. High-Level Synthesis (HLS)
5. Image Processing
6. Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
7. Additional Projects: Other experiments and interesting concepts



Note: I mainly use Xilinx tools.
