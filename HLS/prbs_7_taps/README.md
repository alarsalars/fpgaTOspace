# PRBS 7 Taps for loop back hardware interface test

It is a simple HLS Ip that use to test the interface by using a loop back cable. it main concept depends on the LFSR and XOR for comparing the bits and send a check bit to a cpu or even internal fpga IP.

The Ip got tested in simulation in different senarios. Pictures are included for the design concept and IP overview.
