# PRBS-7 Taps for Loopback Hardware Interface Testing

This project implements a simple HLS IP core designed to test hardware interfaces using a loopback cable. The core leverages a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) and XOR logic to generate and compare bits, sending a check bit to a CPU or internal FPGA IP for validation.

Key Features:
PRBS-7 Generation: Uses LFSR and XOR for generating and comparing bit sequences.
Loopback Testing: Ideal for interface testing via loopback connections.
Simulation Tested: The IP was verified through simulations in multiple scenarios. Design concept and IP overview images are provided for reference.
