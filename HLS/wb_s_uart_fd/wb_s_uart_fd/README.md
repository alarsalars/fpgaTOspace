# Wishbone slave UART half duplex

In this IP i wanted to design my first protocol in HLS, I focused on immplementing the wishbone and UART concept and verifying the design with testbench in HLS.
It has a large room to improving but this is not my target in the time been. However, I made sure to test every detials of the design but not all edge cases.

Note: the output of UART is 10 bits, I made it on perpuse to verify the concept with testbench but it should be 8 bits.
