# VHDL Processor Design with Cocotb Verification

This project is a custom implementation of a processor in VHDL, inspired by Kumar Khandagle's work. While the core concept is based on his design, the code and implementation are my own.

Processor Design: Built using VHDL with internal memory arrays for simplicity, though future iterations could use I/O ports with a bus system for better memory handling.

Future Improvements:
Implement I/O ports with a bus for memory management.
Extend Cocotb coverage for more complex test cases.
